h1. Test environment Grails on OSGi

h2. About

This repository contains the basic settings required to start a Grails application in an OSGi environment. Currently the Grails application will be run as a monolithic bundle containing all dependencies. Further modularization is the next step on this journey. See also my blog at http://blog.jetztgrad.net/grails-on-osgi/

h2. Installation

# Clone this repository
# Get Pax Runner 1.3.0 from http://paxrunner.ops4j.org/ and install it parallel to the repository's directory. 
If you install Pax Runner somewhere else, adjust variable PAXRUNNER_HOME in script runpax.
# Create a simple Grails application with Grails 1.2M4, war it using @grails war@ and set its path in @config/osgitest-app.profile@

h2. Running

Simply run @pax-osgitest@ (Maven will download the Internet, so it takes some time during the first run). Pax Runner configures the OSGi framework, provisiones bundles, starts it and drops you to the OSGi console. 

When running on Windows, the script files @runpax@ and @pax-osgitest@ must be adjusted accordingly. See Pax Runner for notes on special Windows jandling.  

Typing @ss@ shows all installed bundles, @help@ provides info regarding available commands.

h2. Details

The test environment loads the Equinox OSGi Framework (version 3.5.1), Spring-DM 2.0M1, Spring 3.0RC1, Jetty (Tomcat doesn't work right know).
